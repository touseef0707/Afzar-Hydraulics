# Afzar-Hydraulics

A simulation and information platform developed for **Afzar Consultants LLC**, featuring a **Flask-based backend** and a **Next.js frontend**. This project aims to provide basic hydraulic simulations and company-related information.

---

## 🗂️ Project Structure

The repository is organized into two main directories:

- **`flask-api/`** – Contains the Flask-based backend for simulations.  
  🛠️ Deployed via **Render**.

- **`nextjs-main/`** – Contains the Next.js-based frontend website.  
  🚀 Deployed via **Vercel**.

## ⚠️ Performance Note

On initial load, users may experience a slight delay in fetching data from the Flask backend. This is due to limited compute resources allocated on Render’s free tier. We're actively monitoring performance and welcome suggestions for improvement.

For more information about the frontend, please refer to the `README.md` inside the `nextjs-main/` directory.
